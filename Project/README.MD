Instructions for running the code used for this project is as follows. 

*** Due to our website only being able to run locally, as it is not published and being hosted on a webserver,
you must download the folder "Webpage" which contains all of the code.

Using the Webpage
1. Once the folder "Webpage" is downloaded, click on home.html.  This will bring you to the homepage of the website.
2. From here you will see four links at the top of the page in the navigation bar. "Home" takes you to the homepage, 
   but you will already be on this page, so nothing will happen. 
3. There are three other links at the top: "Animation Without Air Resistance", "Animation With Air Resistance", and 
   "Animation From CSV File".  Click on the link for the simulation you would like to run. 
4. Each animation page has instructions on the page for running the simulation and producing an animation.  

Also in the "Project" folder:
- There is a file csv-creation.py which creates a CSV with time and position values for entering in the "Animation From CSV File"
  page on the website.  Open and run csv-creation.py to create the CSV file.
- The CSV file created from csv-creation.py will be titled "projectile_motion.csv".
