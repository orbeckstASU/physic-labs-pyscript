Instructions for running the code used for this project goes as follows. 

*** Using the Webpage ***
There are two ways to use the webpage created: 

Local Use
1. Download the "Webpage" folder from the "Project" folder, and once the folder "Webpage" is downloaded, click on home.html.     This will bring you to the homepage of the website.

2. From here you will see four links at the top of the page in the navigation bar. "Home" takes you to the homepage, but you will already be on this page, so nothing will happen. 

3. There are three other links at the top in the navigation bar: "Animation Without Air Resistance", "Animation With Air Resistance", and "Animation From CSV File".  Click on the link for the simulation you would like to run. 

4. Each animation page has instructions on the page for running the simulation and producing an animation.  

Webpage from Link
1. Visit the link https://fd686e77-1d9b-4864-b678-8a4fc029102a.pyscriptapps.com/gdx-collector/latest/index.html to access the webpage. 

2. You will be brought to the home page, and from there you can use the links in the navigation to access any of the other three animations. 

3. Each animation page has instructions on the page for running the simulation and producing an animation.  


Also in the "Project" folder:
- There is a file csv-creation.py which creates a CSV with time and position values for entering in the "Animation From CSV File"
  page on the website.  Open and run csv-creation.py to create the CSV file.

- The CSV file created from csv-creation.py will be titled "projectile_motion.csv".
