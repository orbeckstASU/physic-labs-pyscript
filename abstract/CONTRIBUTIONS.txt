Tatooine Popular Liberation Front 2025 Final Contributions

Eric Olson: 
- Created the website for the project using html, and styled the website using css. 
- Learned how to use pyscript to incorporate python with html.  
- Created two animations on the website using user input. One is a projectile motion animation without air resistance using
  simple equations of motion, and the other is a projectile motion animation with air resistance and rotation, utilizing rk4 
  integration and functions learned in class. 
- Created a webpage to take input as a csv file. Angel figured out how to produce a plot with the csv data, then I was able 
  to animate those plots.
