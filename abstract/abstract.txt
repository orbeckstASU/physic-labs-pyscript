ABSTRACT 

Often experiments done in labs at schools require limiting proprietary software for analysis which limits the use of these tools, and our project focused on creating an open source web 
based software for all students to use.  Using PyScript, an open source platform for python in the browser, and HTML, we created a website that allows users to 
upload CSV files containing position-time data to automatically visualize motion, velocity, and acceleration. Once the CSV is uploaded, python is used to determine 
the velocity and acceleration through numerical differentiation.  These CSV files can come from sensors such as Vernier motion sensors, integrating real world 
motion from a lab.  Aside from uploading data in the format of a CSV, students can also produce an animation of projectile motion, with or without air resistance, 
by entering initial conditions of the projectile.  This allows students to self discover how different initial conditions affect trajectories.  With the creation 
of animated plots from both CSV files and user inputs, the goals of this project were achieved.  Further development could lead to better visualization tools and 
further applications for other physics experiments.
